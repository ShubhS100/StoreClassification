# StoreClassification

## Problem Statement
Develop logistic regression, decision tree 
models that will identify whether stores will perform well or poorly.

Ivor Buquetlowd, the owner of a chain of over 100 shops in the UK, would like you to 
help grow his business effectively. The shops are all similar, but they make amounts 
of revenue varying from £1 million to nearly £5 million per year. He would like a 
computerised system to analyse the performance of his existing shops to help 
choose new locations for shops
